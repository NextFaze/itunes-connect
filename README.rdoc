= appstore

This gem provides a very simple command-line utility and backing
"library" (if I can be so bold to use the term in this context) for
accessing sales reports from Apple's iTunes Connect website.

== Usage

=== Command-Line Usage

This gem comes with the <tt>appstore</tt> executable which you can use
to download reports, import into a sqlite database and report
from. Simply run the command without any arguments for usage.

One important note, you may specify your iTunes Connect credentials on
the command line _or_ you can put them in YAML format in
<tt>~/.itunesrc</tt> with the keys of <tt>:username</tt> and
<tt>:password</tt>.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
